## About
There are some deep learning algorithms implemented from scratch!
Let's learn deep learning with toy code.

The implementation of toydl is highly inspired by [minitorch](https://github.com/minitorch/minitorch).


## Overview

ToyDL, as an education project, is aimed to make the
concepts behind the deep learning as clear as possible.
I do believe the key to reach the target is **SIMPLE**, as simple as possible.
I'm trying to use little code to build this library, although it's not simple enough yet.
